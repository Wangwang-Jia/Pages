# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science at the ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), under the supervision of Prof. [Florian Tram√®r](https://floriantramer.com/).
I completed my master's degree in [Software Engineering at Zhejiang University](http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/cstenglish/main.htm) in March 2023, advised by Prof. [Chao Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gpTPt58AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Hainan University in July 2020.

<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

**Research Interests**: I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data privacy, data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. Previously, I focused on the following research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data Privacy: Membership Inference Attack
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Continual Learning

**ü§î What I am currently interested in**: For my PhD study, I am currently exploring the aspects of privacy and utility associated with synthetic data, particularly the use of generative models such as GANs or Diffusion models to obtain synthetic data.
