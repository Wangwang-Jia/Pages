# üßê About Me

Hi! I am a master student in Software Engineering at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Chao Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gpTPt58AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree at Hainan University in July 2020. Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks.

**Research Interests**: I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. My long-term research goal is to mine the role of data in AI, and to democratize AI to serve a broader area and population. Currently, I am focusing on these research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Continual Learning

**ü§î What I am currently interested in**: researching the security and privacy issues of AI systems in the real world.
